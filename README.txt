Professor JD has lots of options. Bottles containing all types of potions are stacked on shelves which cover the entire wall from floor to ceiling

Professor JD has broken his bones several times while climbing the top shell for retrieving a potion. He decided to get a ladder for him.

But he has no time to visit Choru. So he instructed Bargav to make a ladder for him. Professor JD specifically wants a step ladder that looks like an inverted 'V' from a side view

Professor just mentioned two things before vanishing

B-separation between left side (LS) and right side (RS) on the ground

LS- the length of left side

What should be the length of RS3 At one extreme LS can be vertical and at other RS can be vertical.

Problem

Bargav is angry and confused.

Can you help him find the minimum and maximum length of RS.
